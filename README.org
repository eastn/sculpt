- Config files for LeapMotion.
- Design and help doc.

** Hardware

- ca 5 contact piezos, connected to any surface of objects, big or small
  - Note: the piezos should be soldered to common audio (mike) cable leading to Arduino (soldering/breadboard) or sound card (TS 0.5" input jack).
- 1 Arduino board for triggering from piezos
- 1 Sound card for audio input from piezos, and for sound output.

- Laptops / macmini

** Software

- SuperCollider
- External libraries for SuperCollider:
  - Utopia ( https://github.com/muellmusik/Utopia )
