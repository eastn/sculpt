* ChucK & WaveGuide synthesis

** SuperCollider meets WaveGuide

ModalBar is a ugen part of WaveGuide synthesis, which will be used as the synthesis engine of the Sculpt.
This is the first experiment using ChucK and WaveGuide, it includes two files, a chuck and a SuperCollider documents that implements an OSC communication between the former and the later. You may find these two within the ChucK folder of the Sculpt repository, as usual.
