extends StkInstrument
(control parameters)
.preset - ( int , READ/WRITE ) - select instrument (0 - 22; see above)
.energy - ( float , READ/WRITE ) - shake energy [0.0 - 1.0]
.decay - ( float , READ/WRITE ) - system decay [0.0 - 1.0]
.objects - ( float , READ/WRITE ) - number of objects [0.0 - 128.0]
(inherited from StkInstrument)
.noteOn - ( float velocity ) - trigger note on
.noteOff - ( float velocity ) - trigger note off
.freq - ( float frequency ) - set/get frequency (Hz)
.controlChange - ( int number, float value ) - assert control change

** Summary - specifics for implementation
Messages to send are:

- preset (int)
- energy (float)
- decay (float)
- objects (float, 1-128)
- noteOn (float velocity)
- noteOff (float velocity)
- freq (float frequency)

* Control change enables extended control - but not needed (?)

.controlChange - ( int number, float value ) - assert control change - numbers are instrument specific, value range: [0.0 - 128.0]

From the notes above, all control parameters are covered by messages, so there seems to be no need to use controlChange.
